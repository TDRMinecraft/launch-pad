# Launch Pad

## 🚀 What is this?

This project is supposed to be a mod manager for [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com).
Instead of trying to create a new standard for mod distribution, the aim of this project is to be a more Mac-friendly
client to the very good [CKAN](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN) mod repository.

## 👽 Why not use the original CKAN Client?

While the original CKAN client is very good on Windows, people sometimes have trouble getting it to work on
macOS. I also want to try my hand at improving the user interface somewhat.

If you want a mac-compatible CKAN client right now and don't mind using the command line, check out
[pyKAN](https://github.com/ajventer/pyKAN).

## 🛰 What is the development status?

Generally speaking, **nothing** is even close to finished.

- You can parse download and parse CKAN files
- You cannot click anything, there is no user interface
- You cannot install mods

## 👾 Name and License

The name of the project is still under debate. It's released under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
